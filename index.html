    <h3> Hawkeye </h3>
    <p class = "description"> Hawkeye is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck, the character first appeared as a villain
      in Tales of Suspense #57 (Sept. 1964) and later joined the Avengers in The Avengers #16 (May 1965). He has
       been a prominent member of the team ever since. He was also ranked at #44 on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book
       Heroes list. In the comics, Hawkeye is deaf, a fact that many fans are pushing to be shown on the big
       screen. He became deaf when he used a sonic arrowhead to stop a villain, which left him deaf and in
       need of hearing aids. Hopefully, in the new TV show his hearing impairment will be addressed. </p>

              <p class = "description"> The Hulk is often used as a metaphor for the repressed side of human nature, or even for the atomic bomb. However, his actions can be seen as a result of anxiety. The Hulk’s earliest stories often depicted him as just wanting to be “left alone.” Many people with anxiety avoid social situations because they’re afraid of how they will be perceived. There’s also the fact that Bruce Banner’s father thought he was a monster for most of his childhood. Now, when Banner actually becomes a monster, all he wants is to be away from everyone else.

(Genius in Action Research Labs), she’s also the daughter of Hank Pym, aka Ant-Man. As it turns out in the series, she shares his bipolar disorder.

                  <h3>Professor X</h3>
                  <p class = "description"> Professor Charles Xavier (colloquial: Professor X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as the founder and sometimes leader of the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963). Xavier is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. The founder of the X-Men, Xavier is an exceptionally powerful telepath who can read and control the minds of others. To both shelter and train mutants from around the world, he runs a private school in the X-Mansion in Salem Center, located in Westchester County, New York.[1] Xavier also strives to serve a greater good by promoting peaceful coexistence and equality between humans and mutants in a world where zealous anti-mutant bigotry is widespread.

                  <h3>Iron Man</h3>
                  <p class = "description"> A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.
Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions).

                  <h3>Mister Fantastic</h3>
                  <p class = "description"> Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. Richards possesses a mastery of mechanical, aerospace and electrical engineering, chemistry, all levels of physics, and human and alien biology. BusinessWeek listed Mr. Fantastic as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.[1] He is the inventor of the spacecraft that was bombarded by cosmic radiation on its maiden voyage, granting the Fantastic Four their powers. Richards gained the ability to stretch his body into any shape he desires.
Mister Fantastic acts as the leader and father figure of the Fantastic Four, and although his cosmic ray powers are primarily stretching abilities, his presence on the team is heavily defined by his scientific acumen, as he is officially acknowledged as the smartest man in the Marvel Universe.[2]This is particularly a point of tragedy in regards to his best friend, Ben Grimm, who he has constantly tried to return back into his human form but typically remains a large, rocky creature called the Thing. He is the loving husband of Susan Storm, father of son Franklin Richards and daughter Valeria Richards, and mentor of his brother-in-law, Johnny Storm.
