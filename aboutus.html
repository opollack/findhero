      <center><h1>Our Mission Statement</h1></center>
      <p class="mission">The world is so much more diverse than what's put on the screen,
        and we want each and every person to have an idol to look up to.
        Everyone is a superhero in their own way, but we want to give them
        a superhero created that they can relate to, to help them through their tough times.
        So look around, and find your superhero!  </p>
