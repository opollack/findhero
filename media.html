 <p id = "first">  Although superhero movies and comics have become more inclusive in the past five years with the creation of the Black Panther and WonderWoman movies, Superheros are prominently white males.
 </p>
 <p id = "second">This quickly becomes an issue with children who idolise and look up to superheroes as role models. It becomes a struggle to find a superhero who looks like them, celebrates the same holidays as them, or has the same disability as them.
 </p>
 <p id = "third">  Growing up with a role model that's very different from you culturally can cause an identity crisis and sometimes a rejection of their own culture.
